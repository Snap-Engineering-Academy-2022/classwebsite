        <p class="album-description">Released on August 23rd of 2013, Six feet beneath the moon is UK based King Krule's debut studio album. Archy Marshall, the man 
            behind King Krule, is a musician, singer, and songwriter that makes unexpected waves with his music and it especially shines in this album. Often there isn't a lot 
            going on with the instrumentation in the album, but yet King Krule manages to make these songs roar with life. One of the key aspects of his songs are his 
            vocals! King Krule's distinct, loud, raw, and bass heavy voice ripples through tracks flooding with power and emotion surely to peak ears.  Despite being young at the time
            and this being King Krule's debut album, he holds a distinct and well structured style that manages to stay unique despite having obvious influences such as jazz.

                And hate runs through my blood
                <br>
                Well, my tongue was in love
                <br>
                but my heart was left above
                <br>
                I've got to be leaving now
                <br>
                I thought I'd never be shot down
                <br>
                But, girl, I'm black and blue
                <br>
                So beaten down for you
                <br>
                Well, I'm beaten down and blue

                <br>
                [Chorus] 
                <br>
                Don't break away

                I waste away
