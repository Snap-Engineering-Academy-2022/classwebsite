      I'm choosing this album because there are a lot of bops in this one. Also
      I heard it live, and it got me simpin hard. Below are some of my favorite
      songs from this album, and why.

        8TEEN - I was 9TEEN when this song came out, but thought it was
        relatable enough & a bop
      </li>
      <li>Coaster - Sad song & a bop</li>
      <li>Location - First song I heard from him & is a bop</li>
